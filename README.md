semaphore
=========

A railway simulator based on the original RISC OS game, RailPro. Semaphore gives you control over points and signals to keep trains arriving and departing from your station on time.

Semaphore is still in the early stages of development. The game inherits all features from the original RailPro as well as some new ones:
- 2D vector graphics rendered in realtime
- An adaptive train scheduler that responds to delays
- No limits on map size, the number of trains, or stations

Semaphore is written with lua, C, cairo and SDL.
