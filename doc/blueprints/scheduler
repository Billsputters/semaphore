Semaphore Blueprint: Scheduler
==============================
James Shaw <js102@zepler.net>

The scheduler plans ahead by a certain amount of time, and maintains a table of 'platform occupation'.  A train spends some duration occupying the platform before attempting to move to its next goal.  This time is called a 'dwell time'.

There are two parameters that a player may vary to change the difficulty of the
game: 'occupation density' and 'adaptiveness'.

Occupation density
------------------
The scheduler allocation fills the schedule to achieve a specified 'occupation density'.  This is a number between 0 and 1--0 means that all platforms are always unoccupied, and 1 means that all platforms are always occupied.

Adaptiveness
------------
When the player is unable to keep up, trains will fall behind schedule.  When this happens, the scheduler is able to adjust its schedule to a certain degree.  'Adaptiveness' is a number between 0 and 1.  0 is the most difficult setting because the schedule will never change once it has been made.

Consider a scenario in which a train arrives at a platform 5 minutes late.  With an adaptiveness of zero, no adjustments are made: subsequent trains scheduled to occupy the same platform keep to their existing schedule.  With an adaptiveness of 1, all subsequent trains are also adjusted by 5 minutes.  An adapativeness of 0.5 would cause trains to be adjusted by 2.5 minutes.
